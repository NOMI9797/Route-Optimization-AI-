# Route Optimization using Genetic Algorithm

This project implements a route optimization solution using Genetic Algorithms to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with real geographic coordinates.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains city coordinates dataset
- `src/`: Source code for genetic algorithm and utilities
- `gui/`: GUI interface implementation
- `results/`: Generated optimization results and visualizations
- `presentation/`: Project documentation and demo materials

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run gui/app.py
```

## Features
- Genetic Algorithm implementation for route optimization
- Real geographic coordinate handling
- Interactive GUI for visualization
- Route optimization visualization # Route-Optimization-AI-
